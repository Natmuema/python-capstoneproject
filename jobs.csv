Software Engineer - Cross-Platform C++ - Multipass


Job Type Full Time , Remote
Qualification BA/BSc/HND
Experience 
Location Nairobi
Job Field ICT / Computer&nbsp




Use your deep C++ skills on Windows and MacOS to build an amazing open source developer experience with Multipass, the workstation mini-cloud at your fingertips which provides Ubuntu and appliance VMs on demand for build, test and prototyping. The Multipass team is hiring a Software Engineer to join our distributed team. We greatly value quality in our code, and great user experience.
Multipass is published for macOS, Windows, and also Linux. Think of it as a workstation mini-cloud. At its simplest you can simply say multipass launch and you will get a new VM on your workstation. You can feed that VM data, just as you would on a public cloud like AWS, Azure or GCP.
The goal is not to be a full cloud of course. The goal is to give developers a local cloud on their workstation, which they can use to run builds in the background, or to try cloud appliances, or to test their own cloud deployments and cloud-init scripts, free of charge. People sometimes use it as a build farm on a shared server, for example.
As a Software Engineer you are expected to play a leadership role designing, mentoring, reviewing and of course coding.

Location: This is a remote position available in EMEA and the Americas.
What you will focus on

Ensure Multipass is easy and intuitive to use
Architect new features and design the user experience
Write high-quality code to create new features and fix bugs
Review code and architecture as part of Canonical's engineering process
Collaborate proactively with a distributed team
Debug, track down and fix issues encountered by our users
Foster the open source community and support customers when needed
Travel internationally for up to two weeks, twice a year, for company events

What we are looking for in you

Cross-platform development experience on macOS and/or Windows
Expertise in modern C++ development
Experience with software testing and test-driven development
Extremely high personal standards for code quality, testing and design
Knowledge of hypervisor technologies such as Hyper-V, VirtualBox, KVM, and QEMU
Open source experience and involvement
Knowledge of CI systems a plus
Capacity to learn quickly about new systems and techniques
Excellent communication skills in English - both verbal and written
Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
